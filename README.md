Streaming user behavior analysis project for retention patterns

# Project Title: Streaming Retention Analysis

## Objective
Analyze user behavior on a streaming platform to understand retention patterns and identify factors that influence continued engagement.

## Project Structure
- `data/` — raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `scripts/` — Python scripts used for automation or cleaning
- `outputs/` — visualizations, reports, and conclusions

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Key Questions
- What % of users return after their first session?
- What usage patterns predict high retention?
- How does content genre or time spent affect retention?

## Dataset
*(Brief description of the dataset source and structure)*

## Results
*(Summary of your findings — charts, insights, etc.)*

## Insights (to be filled)
- [ ] Retention rate over time
- [ ] Behavior of high-retention vs. low-retention users
- [ ] Genre or time-of-day effects

## Lessons Learned
*(Reflection on what you learned technically and analytically)*
- Using Python for real-world analytics
- Data storytelling through visualization
- Thinking critically about metrics
